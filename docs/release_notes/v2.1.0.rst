Updates / New Features
----------------------

  - Converted runtime dependencies to ``[tool.poetry.dependencies]`` including numpy, scipy, PyYAML, pydantic, albucore, opencv-python-headless
  - Migrated optional dependencies to ``[tool.poetry.extras]`` (hub, pytorch, text)
  - Created ``[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]`` for development tools from requirements-dev.txt
  - Updated package configuration to Poetry's packages format


* CI/CD:

  - Converted ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` to use Poetry for all operations

  - Maintained multi-platform testing across Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
  - Preserved Python 3.9-3.12 test matrix

  - Added ``.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`` for dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Added ``.github/workflows/publish.yml`` for automated PyPI publishing on version tags, using Poetry build system

* Fork-Specific Changes:

  - Removed automatic version checking against PyPI (``albumentations/check_version.py`` and ``tests/test_check_version.py``)
  - Removed ``check_for_updates()`` call from ``albumentations/__init__.py`` to prevent confusion with upstream package
  - Rewrote ``README.md`` to clearly identify this as an NRTK fork maintained by Kitware

  - Removed AlbumentationsX deprecation notice (not relevant to NRTK fork)
  - Updated badges to point to Kitware repository
  - Updated documentation links to point to ``nrtk-albumentations.readthedocs.io``

  - Updated ``docs/contributing/coding_guidelines.md`` to remove original project community links
  - Modified ``tools/make_transforms_docs.py`` to remove links to explore.albumentations.ai
  - Removed ``conda.recipe/`` directory (not distributing via Anaconda)
  - Removed ``[tool.albumentations.maintainers]`` section from ``pyproject.toml`` (original maintainers credited in LICENSE and README)
  - Updated ``albumentations/core/hub_mixin.py`` error message to reference ``nrtk-albumentations[hub]``
  - Updated ``tools/check_albucore_version.py`` to check ``pyproject.toml`` instead of ``setup.py``
  - Updated ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` to trigger albucore version check on ``pyproject.toml``
