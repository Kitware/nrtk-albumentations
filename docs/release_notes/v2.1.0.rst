v2.1.0
======

This is the initial release of ``nrtk-albumentations``, a fork of Albumentations v2.0.8 maintained by Kitware
in direct support of `NRTK (Natural Robustness Toolkit) <https://github.com/Kitware/nrtk>`_. This fork provides
fast and flexible image augmentation capabilities specifically tailored for NRTK's natural robustness evaluation workflows.

Key highlights of this release include:

* Migration from setuptools to Poetry for modern Python package management
* Updated CI/CD workflows with Poetry integration and automated PyPI publishing
* Fork-specific modifications to clearly identify this as an NRTK support package
* Removal of upstream-specific features (version checking, marketing content, conda distribution)
* Streamlined documentation focused on NRTK integration use cases

This package is designed to be used with NRTK's ``AlbumentationsPerturber`` and includes 70+ image augmentation
transforms supporting classification, segmentation, object detection, pose estimation, and 3D volumetric data.

Updates / New Features
----------------------

* Build System & Project Configuration:

  - Migrated from ``setuptools`` to Poetry build system (``poetry.core.masonry.api``)
  - Converted ``pyproject.toml`` structure: ``[project]`` to ``[tool.poetry]``
  - Migrated all project metadata (name, version, description, authors, license, keywords, classifiers)
  - Converted runtime dependencies to ``[tool.poetry.dependencies]`` including numpy, scipy, PyYAML, pydantic, albucore, opencv-python-headless
  - Migrated optional dependencies to ``[tool.poetry.extras]`` (hub, pytorch, text)
  - Created ``[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]`` for development tools from requirements-dev.txt
  - Updated package configuration to Poetry's packages format


* CI/CD:

  - Converted ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` to use Poetry for all operations
  - Replaced ``uv`` package installer with ``poetry install``
  - Updated all test and check commands to use ``poetry run`` prefix
  - Changed caching strategy from pip cache to Poetry virtualenvs (``${cache-dir}/virtualenvs``)
  - Migrated to ``snok/install-poetry@v1`` action for Poetry installation
  - Maintained multi-platform testing across Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
  - Preserved Python 3.9-3.12 test matrix
  - Retained OpenCV headless replacement logic for CI environments
  - Organized workflow into separate jobs: core tests, pre-commit hooks, and defaults checking
  - Removed transform documentation check job from CI (README uses streamlined transform list for NRTK fork)
  - Added ``.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`` for dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Added ``.github/workflows/publish.yml`` for automated PyPI publishing on version tags, using Poetry build system

* Fork-Specific Changes:

  - Removed automatic version checking against PyPI (``albumentations/check_version.py`` and ``tests/test_check_version.py``)
  - Removed ``check_for_updates()`` call from ``albumentations/__init__.py`` to prevent confusion with upstream package
  - Rewrote ``README.md`` to clearly identify this as an NRTK fork maintained by Kitware
  - Removed all original project marketing content (newsletter, Discord, Twitter, LinkedIn, company logos)
  - Removed AlbumentationsX deprecation notice (not relevant to NRTK fork)
  - Updated badges to point to Kitware repository
  - Updated documentation links to point to ``nrtk-albumentations.readthedocs.io``
  - Streamlined documentation to focus on NRTK integration use cases
  - Updated ``docs/contributing/environment_setup.md`` to reflect Poetry-based setup and NRTK context
  - Updated ``docs/contributing/coding_guidelines.md`` to remove original project community links
  - Modified ``tools/make_transforms_docs.py`` to remove links to explore.albumentations.ai
  - Removed ``conda.recipe/`` directory (not distributing via Anaconda)
  - Removed ``[tool.albumentations.maintainers]`` section from ``pyproject.toml`` (original maintainers credited in LICENSE and README)
  - Updated ``albumentations/core/hub_mixin.py`` error message to reference ``nrtk-albumentations[hub]``
  - Updated ``tools/check_albucore_version.py`` to check ``pyproject.toml`` instead of ``setup.py``
  - Updated ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` to trigger albucore version check on ``pyproject.toml``
  - Removed ``benchmark/**`` path ignore from ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` (directory doesn't exist)
